 # СO2 Carbon emissions calculation tool

The total carbon emissions for projects in RVT and IFS format can be calculated by multiplying the volume of the element groups by the corresponding energy carbon emission factor.

Embodied carbon is the carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions associated with materials and construction processes throughout the whole lifecycle of a building or infrastructure.

It includes any CO₂ created during the manufacturing of building materials (material extraction, transport to manufacturer, manufacturing), the transport of those materials to the job site, and the construction practices used.

OpenDataBIM transferring information to another party without the need for external guarantors or trusted ‘third parties’, enabling data to be exchanged within 3D-7D systems and between construction parties directly, bypassing any third-party companies controlling data storage and transfer. OpenDataBIM allows you to automate work with project data. In order to get automatic data from thousands of projects automatically, you need to build the pipeline once on the open tools.
